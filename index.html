				<h3>Incredible topics & discussions</h3>
					<p>The episode topics are relevant for today’s dating scenes. You’re able to hear different scenarios and opinions about dating, relationships, sex, situationships, and more. I love learning about how each person’s mind works and being able to relate to some of them. The podcast allows for both women and men to be able to understand more about each other’s thought process and even submit questions through their IG to get advice.</p>

				<h1>About</h1>
					<p>My name is Darmante and im the host of What Wo(men) Want! I'm originally from Pittsburgh, PA but I now reside in Brooklyn, NY. The topic of dating is something I constantly speak about with friends, family, and even strangers. With a wealth of first hand experience and countless stories/scenarios from others, I decided why not take these great conversations to a platform for the world to tune into. My goal is to cultivate a community that shares and learns about dating, sex, and relationships. Be sure to tune in!</p>
